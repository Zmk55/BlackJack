## 🔧 Development Setup

1. **Install Go 1.22+**
   ```bash
   # Download and install Go
   wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.22.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
   sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.22.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
   export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
   ```

2. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/blackjack
   go mod tidy
   make build
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   ./build/blackjack
   ```

## 📋 Current Capabilities

- ✅ Project structure and build system
- ✅ Configuration management
- ✅ Data models and YAML storage
- ✅ Basic TUI layout
- ✅ Keybind routing
- ✅ Documentation and examples

## 🎯 Next Development Session

1. **Implement CRUD modals** for hosts and groups
2. **Add fuzzy search** functionality
3. **Implement SSH connection** flow
4. **Create SFTP browser** interface
5. **Add import/export** functionality

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes:
- ✅ Structure validation script (`test_structure.sh`)
- ✅ Example data files for testing
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Build system with multiple targets

## 📝 Notes

- All code follows Go best practices
- YAML files are human-readable and editable
- Configuration is XDG-compliant
- TUI uses tview for consistent interface
- Security considerations built-in (no plaintext passwords)
- Extensible architecture for future features

The foundation is solid and ready for the next phase of development!
